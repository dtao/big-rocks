# Big Rocks

Big Rocks asks you how you want to spend your time, then looks at your calendar to help you figure out how you're _actually_ spending that time, and works with you to bring those things together.

## TODO

- [x] Integrate with Google Calendar API
- [ ] Allow the user to define how they want to spend their time
- [ ] Allow the user to categorize past calendar events
- [ ] Show the user the delta between what they want to do and what they're actually doing
- [ ] Enable the user to schedule time in advance to ensure they're focused on the right things
